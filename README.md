## What Is PromptCrafter?

PromptCrafter is a desktop application for crafting AI prompts with complete privacy. All processing happens locally on your machine using Ollama with Gemma 3 models.

**Complete Privacy**: No data ever leaves your computer. All AI processing runs locally through Ollama.

**Local Storage**: Your chats, saved presets, and settings are stored locally in the app’s profile (Electron’s Chromium storage: localStorage/IndexedDB). You can view the exact paths and factory‑reset from the in‑app Data Location panel.

**Modern Interface**: Clean, beautiful design with three themes and responsive layout that works on any screen size.

## Features

### AI Integration

- **Provider: Ollama (local only)** — no cloud providers

## Getting Started

### What You Need

Before using PromptCrafter, you need:

1. **Ollama** installed and running on your computer
2. At least one **Gemma 3 model** downloaded through Ollama

### Install Ollama

**Windows, macOS & Linux:**

Download the installer from <https://ollama.ai/download>

Or you can download using CLI:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

### Download a Gemma 3 Model

1. Start Ollama and open your terminal
2. Run these commands based on what model, or models, you would like integrated:

```bash
ollama pull gemma3:1b   # Smallest, fastest (good for testing)
ollama pull gemma3:4b   # Recommended model for most use-cases
ollama pull gemma3:12b  # Better quality, needs more RAM
ollama pull gemma3:27b  # Best quality, but needs very powerful hardware
```

We recommend starting with `gemma3:4b` by running `ollama pull gemma3:4b` for the best balance of speed and quality.

### Start Using PromptCrafter

1. **Launch the app** from your applications folder or desktop shortcut
2. **Configure Gemma 3 (Ollama) connection** when the dialog appears
   - Keep the default base URL `http://localhost:11434` unless you changed Ollama’s port
   - Click “Check for models” to detect available `gemma3` models
   - Pick a model (we recommend `gemma3:4b`) and save
3. **Start chatting** and creating prompts!

The app automatically detects when Ollama is running and which Gemma 3 models are available.

## Using the App

### Creating Your First Prompt

1. Type your request or question in the chat input
2. Adjust settings like task type, tone, and detail level using the sidebar controls
3. Click Send or press Enter
4. Review the AI's response
5. Continue the conversation or start a new chat

### Saving Presets

If you find settings you like:

1. Click the **Save Preset** button in the sidebar
2. Give your preset a name
3. Access it anytime from the **Presets** menu

### Switching Models

Open the Gemma 3 connection dialog (model badge/menu in the top bar), then select a different Gemma 3 size. Switching takes effect immediately once saved.

### Changing Themes

1. Click the **Settings** menu (gear icon)
2. Choose from Default, WarmEarth, or Light theme
3. Your choice is saved automatically

## Privacy & Data

**Everything is local.** PromptCrafter:

- Never connects to external services (only your local Ollama at `http://localhost:11434`)
- Stores chats, presets, and settings in your OS profile under the app’s user data directory (Chromium localStorage/IndexedDB)
- Doesn't collect telemetry or usage data
- Gives you complete control over your conversations

To completely reset the app, open Settings → Data Location and click Factory Reset (or manually delete the PromptCrafter user data directory shown there).

## Building from Source

If you want to modify PromptCrafter or build it yourself:

**Requirements:**

- Node.js 18.18 or newer (20+ recommended)
- npm package manager

**Quick start:**

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the desktop app in development mode
npm run dev
```

**Build installers:**

```bash
# Windows installer and portable
npm run dist:win

# All platforms (requires platform-specific build tools)
npm run dist:electron
```

**Technology stack:**

- Desktop: Electron
- Frontend: Next.js with React
- Styling: Tailwind CSS
- Language: TypeScript
- Storage: Electron localStorage/IndexedDB (persistent) + in‑memory stores (runtime)

### Project Structure (high-level)

- `electron/` — Electron main, preload, and dev/start scripts
- `src/app/` — Next.js App Router pages and UI
- `src/components/` — Shared UI components
- `src/lib/` — Local storage helpers, model config, presets
- `src/server/` — Local-only services (model validation, in-memory data layer)
